INTRODUCTION
============

  The Multiplicative Intrinsic Component Optimization (MICO) software implements
  an algorithm for simultaneous bias field estimation and tissue segmentation [1, 2].
  The MICO algorithm estimates the bias field and the true image, which are two
  multiplicative components of a given MR image. The bias field is approximated
  by a linear combination of a set of smooth basis functions.
  The true image is represented by tissue membership functions and the corresponding
  true intensity means (TIM). The bias field and the true image are optimized by
  minimizing an energy function in terms  of the combination coefficients in the
  linear combination of the basis functions, the tissue membership functions,
  and the corresponding TIMs.

  The initial MATLAB implementation of MICO and the development of the method
  has been in part developed at the Vanderbilt University Institute of Imaging
  Science [3] under the supervision of John C. Gore.

  Binary Package
  --------------

  For details on where the built executables and libraries, the auxiliary data,
  and the documentation files are installed, please refer to the INSTALL file.



LICENSING
=========

  See http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/license.html or COPYING file.



INSTALLATION
============

  See build and installation instructions given in the INSTALL file.



DOCUMENTATION
=============

  See the software manual for details on the software including a demonstration
  of how to apply the software tools provided by this package.

  The API documentation generated by Doxygen documents the C++ interface of the
  mico library. External C++ code can link directly to this library to make use
  of the MICO implementations instead of running the mico command as separate
  process. You find the API documentation in the doc/api/ subdirectory of your
  installation (if it was build as part of the build and installation, see
  instructions in the INSTALL file), or at
  http://www.rad.upenn.edu/sbia/software/doxygen/mico/1.0/html/.
